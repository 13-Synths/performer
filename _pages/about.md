# About

## Hi!

I'm Simon, the developer of the **per\|former** sequencer. I got into electronic music creation and programming in my early childhood and have been hooked ever since. Around 3 years ago, I decided to dive into eurorack modular synthesizers, having stayed away from them for many years, due to the cost involved in building such a system. When I realized that there is a huge DIY community and I could build an entire system myself, hopefully at a fraction of the cost, I couldn't resist. My journey started off by building some full kits found on Thonk, Synthcube and Modular Addict. After that, I started sourcing my own parts and only bought PCBs and panels to reduce cost even more. Later I got into SMD solding and built many of the Mutable Instrument modules and also wrote some custom firmware modifications. I also started getting more interested in the circuit design of these modules.

With a reasonably sized system, I did lack a good sequencer and bought an Arturia Beatstep Pro, which kind of broke my DIY mentality. This is when I decided to start working on my own sequencer module. My main motivation was to create the sequencer that I would love to use, but at the same time I wanted other people to be able to build one too. Because of this, I decided to make the hardware design and software open source.

I'm excited to see how other people are using this sequencer module and how many decide to build one. Should there be enough demand from people that don't have the skills to build their own module, I will consider making a commercial version. But this will most probably not happen in the near future.
